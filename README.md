# Stick

An OSINT tool similar as [Squiz](https://github.com/traumatism/squiz) but in... Rust !

Yes... that cute crab seduced me... but i'm not quitting Python at all (at least now ^^): indeed, Stick use Python 3 as a scripting language to write modules !


Note: it's still in developement, i'll update this readme file ASAP
